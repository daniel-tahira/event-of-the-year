<!-- line 29 and 32 are classes from bootstrap 
video 72 talks about layouts -- positioning buttons with bootstrap -- note that we'll see CSS Grid which is the way easier to layout your page

when adding the bootstrap classes .container and .row are used to  wrap the h1 and the button in a container and in the same row according to the bootstrap grid system (you can "inspect" the doc in developer view )

.text-center is a bootstrap class that centers the elements in the container. however, bootstrap is divided into columns, hence we need to "advise it that it'll take the full length of the row by adding the class col-12"

But we still need to align the elements VERTICALLY (tricky part) - we need to use FLEX from bootstrap. (consult "flex" in bootstrap page)

so to enable flex (flexbox) we need to add d-flex class

then check the "align items" section, in this case we'll need the class "align-items-center", but it'll not work just adding this, this is because if we inspect the container we'll see that it doesn't take the total height of the page. To do that we need to add the "h-100" class
